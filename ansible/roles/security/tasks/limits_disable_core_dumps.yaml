#
# Each line describes a limit for a user in the form:
# 
# <domain>        <type>  <item>  <value>
# <domain> can be:
#         - a user name
#         - a group name, with @group syntax
#         - the wildcard *, for default entry
#         - the wildcard %, can be also used with %group syntax,
#                  for maxlogin limit
#         - NOTE: group and wildcard limits are not applied to root.
#           To apply a limit to the root user, <domain> must be
#           the literal username root.
# 
# <type> can have the two values:
#         - "soft" for enforcing the soft limits
#         - "hard" for enforcing hard limits
# 
# <item> can be one of the following:
#         - core - limits the core file size (KB)
#         - data - max data size (KB)
#         - fsize - maximum filesize (KB)
#         - memlock - max locked-in-memory address space (KB)
#         - nofile - max number of open files
#         - rss - max resident set size (KB)
#         - stack - max stack size (KB)
#         - cpu - max CPU time (MIN)
#         - nproc - max number of processes
#         - as - address space limit (KB)
#         - maxlogins - max number of logins for this user
#         - maxsyslogins - max number of logins on the system
#         - priority - the priority to run user process with
#         - locks - max number of file locks the user can hold
#         - sigpending - max number of pending signals
#         - msgqueue - max memory used by POSIX message queues (bytes)
#         - nice - max nice priority allowed to raise to values: [-20, 19]
#         - rtprio - max realtime priority
#         - chroot - change root to directory (Debian-specific)
